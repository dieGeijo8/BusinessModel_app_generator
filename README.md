# Generator of streamlit web apps for maturity assessments
This programs allows to generate a complete streamlit web app for business maturity assessments. 
The generated web applications are multipage web applications that allow to collect and display real time updated data. The web applications provide user-authentication
and data persistency. The data inserted is stored in a Firestore DB.

To create a web application you need first to store in the dedicated directories a configuration file, whith informations on the maturity assessment, and 
a json file containing credentials to connect to a Firestore DB. After that you have to run the launch_app.py script.

I apologize if some things are not clear, I will be uploading more documentation in the following weeks.

This work was done during my internship at Sourcing Champions, a procurement consultancy based in Amsterdam.
